Здраво, cucumber souls!<br>
Fresh cucumbers from grandmother's garden - or market, no shame.<br>
Dill from homeland, crisp and proud.<br>
Garlic - crush like old Soviet machinery.<br>
Salt from deep Carpathian mines.<br>
Brine must sing with tradition's whispers.<br>
One handful salt, two handfuls love.<br>
Barrel or glass jar - both will work, no argument.<br>
Cold water from mountain spring - if you have connection.<br>
Peppercorns like scattered memories.<br>
Cover, wait 3-4 days - not rushed, not lazy.<br>
Pickles become medicine for soul, for family.<br>
Смачного! (Enjoy your meal!)<br>
